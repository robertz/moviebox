MovieBox
========

Personal video server built on top of ColdBox

MovieBox was inspired by keyStream by Cory Fail. Where keyStream is meant for easy setup and use MovieBox requires a certain amount of knowledge creating 
datasources and hooking into your web server. Your movie library is expected to be outside of the webroot but accessible by your web server through a virtual 
mapping or alias.

Features
========

* Built with ColdBox
* Uses only HTML5 to stream your media to your devices
* Uses themoviedb.org for getting movie metadata. It will also download covers and backdrops for you

Caveats

This project is still very much a work in progress.
